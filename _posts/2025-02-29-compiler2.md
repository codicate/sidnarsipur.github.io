Before we move on to covering dataflow analysis, I thought it would interesting to cover an example of such an analysis to motivate its discussion.

# Live Variable Analysis

A Control flow graph represents our source code in a data structure that allows us to analyze properties of our program very easily. 

For example, consider the C program that calculates the minimum of two numbers:

```
int minimum(int x, int y) {
    int r = -1;
  
    if(x > y)
      r = y;
    else
      r = x;
  
    return r;
}
```

In three-address form:

```
    r = -1
    t0 = x > y
    if (t0 == 0)  goto L1
    r = y
    goto L0

L1:
    r = x
    goto L0

L0:
    return r

```

In CFG form:

</div>

<br>

At the return statement, what value of r is "alive"? Informally, a variable is alive after its definition upto a point in the program where it is re-defined on all possible paths.

In the CFG above, we can see that `r = -1` is no longer alive at the return statement as all edges coming into the return statement have a write to r.

Doing live variable analysis helps us remove unnecessary statements from the program while maintaining correctness. In this example, the `r = -1` assignment can be safely removed. 

How do we calculate live variables for more complex programs?

At the level of a basic block, we need to define two sets: `DEF` and `USE`. 

`DEF` is the set of variables written (or defined) in the block.
`USE` is the set of variables read from in the block.

```
BB001:
    x = 10
    y = z + 10

DEF(BB001) = {x, y}
USE(BB001) = {z}


BB002:
    a = 10 + j
    j = 25 + x

DEF(BB002) = {a, j}
USE(BB002) = {j, x}
```

Our goal is to calculate `IN` and `OUT`, the set of variables that are alive, entering and leaving, a basic block.

Calculating `OUT` is easy - it's just the union of all the `IN` sets in b's successors.

`OUT(b) = ∪ (IN(s) for s in SUCC(b))`

Why don't we define it the other way around? Take a moment and think about what *direction* facts flow in. Live variable analysis asks whether our variable is alive in the paths *after* ours, i.e., subsequent instructions. This means that facts flow from lower nodes to higher nodes, or backwards. Therefore, `OUT` is defined as a union of successor `IN` sets.

Now let's try and find `IN(b)`

```
BB009:
    x = 10 + y
```

In the above example, `y` is clearly in the `USE` set of `BB009`, but it hasn't been defined in the same block. Therefore, `y` had to have been defined earlier in the program and has to be alive *entering* the block.

That's the first part of the formula:
`IN(b) = USE(b)`

Vice versa, if a variable is alive in subsequent blocks without a definition, it has to been alive in our block (remember that `OUT(b)` is defined on successors).
`IN(b) = USE(b) ∪ OUT(b)` 

However, there is a problem in the equation. If we re-define a variable within our block, it is no longer alive entering the block; the block kill all its previous definitions. We need to remove the variables a block defines `DEF(b)` from the variables that are used in outgoing paths `OUT(b)`.

This completes our equation:
`IN(b) = USE(b) ∪ (OUT(b) - DEF(b))`

If you think of yourself as a block, the variable is alive coming in if I use it or any of my succesors use it, *unless* I define it myself. 

Wait? Aren't `IN` and `OUT` dependent on each other? To fix that, we define a special node called `EXIT` whose `IN` set is initialized to be empty. This serves as the base case in the recursive equation.

To calculate the `IN` and `OUT` set for each block, we can start from any block, and begin solving the equations for each block in our CFG. We stop when we reach a *fixpoint* - a round of iteration on the CFG where none of the `IN` sets have changed.

Let us run through an example of live variable analysis. Consider the CFG below where `BB001` has an edge to `BB002`, which has an edge to `BB003`.

For backwards analysis, we usually begin with the last node (`BB003` in this example)

```
BB001:
    a = 3; 
    b = 5;
    d = 4;
    x = 100;  

BB002: 
    c = a + b;
    d = 2;

BB003: 
    c = 4;
    return b * d + c;

    DEF(BB003) = {c}
    USE(BB003) = {b, d}

    OUT(BB003) = {} [Remember: IN(EXIT) = {}]
    IN(BB003) = {b, d, c} ∪ ({} - {c}) = {b, d}
```

We then move onto `BB002`:

```
BB001:
    a = 3; 
    b = 5;
    d = 4;
    x = 100;  

BB002: 
    c = a + b;
    d = 2;

    DEF(BB002) = {c, d}
    USE(BB002) = {a, b}

    OUT(BB003) = {b, d} [from IN(BB003)]
    IN(BB003) = {a, b} ∪ ({b, d} - {c, d}) = {a, b}

BB003: 
    c = 4;
    return b * d + c;

    OUT(BB003) = {}
    IN(BB003) = {b, d}
```

We then move onto `BB001`:

```
BB001:
    a = 3; 
    b = 5;
    d = 4;
    x = 100;  

    DEF(BB001) = {a, b, d, x}
    USE(BB001) = {}

    OUT(BB003) = {a, b} [from IN[BB002]]
    IN(BB003) = {} ∪ ({a, b} - {a, b, d, x}) = {}

BB002: 
    c = a + b;
    d = 2;

    OUT(BB003) = {b, d}
    IN(BB003) = {a, b}

BB003: 
    c = 4;
    return b * d + c;

    OUT(BB003) = {}
    IN(BB003) = {b, d}
```

Since this CFG is a single chain, we are done. However, if our CFG contained multiple join nodes, we would need to run multiple iterations of equation solving until we reach a fixpoint. These iterations of solving equations is known as iterative dataflow analysis.

The `OUT` set for `BB001` tells us that `d` is not alive leaving the block, so our compiler can safely remove the instruction `d = 4`. We can also see that `a` is not alive leaving block `BB002`, information our compiler can use to optimize register allocation.

It is important to note that due to the way we have setup the `IN` and `OUT` equations, we will *always* reach a fixpoint as the size of the `OUT` set can only increase (monotonic non-decreasing), and there is a finite bound to its size (the set of variables in the source code).

We can formally prove such properties using dataflow analysis, which I will talk about in the next post. Live variable analysis is an example of a dataflow analysis, which uses *backwards* iteration and a *union* meet operator.
