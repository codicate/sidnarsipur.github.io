Families, sororities, clubs, and other groups often want to donate together for a good cause but usually end up supporting one chosen by only a few members. What if we could securely analyze your interests, find common ground among a larger group, and magically match you with a charity that resonates with everyone?

Group4Good safely accesses your purchase data to identify transactions relevant to non-profit causes and anonymously records your recurring preferences within a larger group. You can create groups, share a unique code with others to join, and then pool and analyze these collective preferences. The results are matched with non-profits that align closely with what matters to you.
