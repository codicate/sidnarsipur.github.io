Netherite is a full-stack application that serves as an AI-powered Github for notes, enabling users to share their notes publicly and discover relevant ones in the community through smart vector search.

Built with NextJS, React & Python, we were awarded 2nd place at the University of Rochester's annual Hackathon, DandyHacks.
