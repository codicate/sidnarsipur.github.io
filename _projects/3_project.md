I'm currently a research assistant at the [URCS Bear Lab](https://rochester-bear-lab.github.io/), advised by [Yukang Yan](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/people/faculty/yan_yukang/index.html).

My work deals with automatically generating a Mixed Reality (MR) user interface for multiple (different) environments at once.

    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/Poster.png" title="Poster" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
