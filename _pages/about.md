Hi, I'm a junior at the University of Rochester studying Computer Science, with a minor in Political Science and cluster in Media Studies.

I spent Summer 2023 interning for the software engineering team at LiquiDonate, working on extending their core marketplace products to APIs and building internal tools for the sales/operations teams.

I'm currently a research assistant at the URCS Bear Lab under Yukang Yan, working on automatically generating unified Mixed Reality (MR) interfaces for multiple environments at once. I'm been awarded the Schwartz Discover Grant to support my research.

My main interests and areas of passion are in Computer Vision, Computer Systems/Architecture, and Mixed Reality. I'm currently for internship oppurtunities starting Summer 2025, with a focus on software engineering roles, particularly backend, systems, or full-stack positions.
