Hi, I'm a junior at the University of Rochester studying Computer Science, with a minor in Political Science and cluster in Media Studies.

I spent Summer 2023 interning for the software engineering team at [LiquiDonate](https://liquidonate.com/), working on extending their core marketplace products to APIs and building internal tools for the sales/operations teams.

I'm currently a research assistant at the [URCS Bear Lab](https://rochester-bear-lab.github.io/) under [Yukang Yan](https://www.cs.rochester.edu/people/faculty/yan_yukang/index.html), working on automatically generating unified Mixed Reality (MR) interfaces for multiple environments at once. I'm been awarded the [Schwartz Discover Grant](https://www.rochester.edu/college/ugresearch/funding/discover-grant/index.html) to support my research.

My main interests and areas of passion are in Computer Vision, Computer Systems/Architecture, and Mixed Reality. I'm currently for internship oppurtunities starting Summer 2025, with a focus on software engineering roles, particularly backend, systems, or full-stack positions.
